# Model Definition and Evaluation

## Overview

In this section, you will define, implement, and evaluate the machine learning model for your project. Your aim should be to improve upon the baseline model and try different approaches to achieve better performance.

## Guidelines

1. **Model Selection**: Discuss the type(s) of models you consider for this task, and justify the selection.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Describe any additional feature engineering you've performed beyond what was done for the baseline model.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Discuss any hyperparameter tuning or optimization methods you've applied.

4. **Implementation**: Use the provided Jupyter/Colab notebook (`model_definition_evaluation.ipynb`) for your code.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Clearly specify which metrics you'll use to evaluate the model performance, and why you've chosen these metrics.

6. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the performance of your model(s) against the baseline model.

## Structure

Your Model section should be organized as follows:

1. **Model Selection**: Document your choice of models and justification in the `model_definition_evaluation.ipynb`.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Describe your feature engineering steps in the `model_definition_evaluation.ipynb`.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Discuss hyperparameter tuning in the `model_definition_evaluation.ipynb`.

4. **Implementation**: The code for implementing the model should be in the `model_definition_evaluation.ipynb`.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Describe and calculate evaluation metrics in the `model_definition_evaluation.ipynb`.

6. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the model performance against the baseline in the `model_definition_evaluation.ipynb`.

## Submission

1. Add your completed Model content in this directory.
2. Make sure your Jupyter/Colab notebook is well-documented, with comments explaining your code and markdown cells interpreting your findings.
