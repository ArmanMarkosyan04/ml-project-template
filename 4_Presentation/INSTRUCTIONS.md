# Project Presentation

## Overview

The project presentation is your opportunity to showcase your entire machine learning project, from problem formulation to your final results. This presentation should provide a comprehensive overview, explain the decisions you've made along the way, and highlight the results and findings of your project.

**Maximum Duration**: The presentation should not exceed 15 minutes, followed by a short Q&A part.

## Guidelines

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the problem you are solving, the dataset used, and the type of task (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).

2. **Literature Review**: Indicate solutions you've found that are related to your project.

3. **Dataset Characteristics**: Provide an overview of your dataset, including any preprocessing and feature engineering steps.

4. **Baseline Model**: Quickly recap your baseline model, its performance, and why it was chosen.

5. **Model Definition and Evaluation**: Discuss the models you've implemented, the feature engineering steps you've taken, and how you evaluated their performance. Include a screenshot of the code you used to implement the model.

6. **Results**: Present the results in a clear and easy-to-understand format. Use tables, charts, or any other visual aids that you find appropriate.

7. **Challenges and Errors**: Discuss the most challenging issue or error you encountered during the data preparation or modeling phase, and how you overcame it.

8. **Discussion**: Reflect on the performance of your models compared to the baseline, and discuss any limitations and future work.

9. **Q&A**: Be prepared to answer questions from the audience or instructor.

## Structure

Your presentation should generally follow this structure:

1. **Title Slide**: Project name, names of the project team, date, and any other relevant information.

2. **Introduction**: 1-2 slides briefly introducing your project.

3. **Literature Review**: 1 slide highlighting related work.

4. **Dataset Characteristics**: 1-2 slides.

5. **Baseline Model**: 1 slide.

6. **Model Definition and Evaluation**: 3-4 slides.

7. **Results**: 2-3 slides.

8. **Challenges and Errors**: 1 slide.

9. **Discussion**: 1-2 slides.

10. **Conclusion and Future Work**: 1 slide.

11. **Q&A**: Final slide indicating the Q&A part.

## Submission

1. Prepare your slides in a format that is easy to present and share (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides, PDF).
2. Save the presentation slides in the folder `4_Presentation`.
3. Replace the image in the folder CoverImage with an image from your presentation (it will serve as cover image for the project)
4. Complete the [README](../README.md) in the top folder with your project specific info.
5. Change the link in the [README](README.md) in this folder to point to your presentation slides.
6. Login under [edu.opencampus.sh](https://edu.opencampus.sh) and:
   - go to the page of the course in which you are conducting the project
   - in the achievement section, select the title of your project
   - download the provided instructions to review if there are any specific instructions for your project
   - upload the [README](README.md) file of your repo (only that one) using the upload button

After the final deadline for the submission, the projects will be reviewed and the certificates will be issued.
