# Final Project Presentation

## Overview

The final project presentation is your opportunity to showcase your entire machine learning project, from problem formulation to your final results. This presentation should provide a comprehensive overview, explain the decisions you've made along the way, and highlight the results and findings of your project.

## Guidelines

1. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce the problem you are solving, the dataset used, and the type of task (classification, regression, clustering, etc.).

2. **Literature Review**: Summarize the research and existing solutions you've found that are related to your project.

3. **Dataset Characteristics**: Provide an overview of your dataset, including any preprocessing and feature engineering steps.

4. **Baseline Model**: Quickly recap your baseline model, its performance, and why it was chosen.

5. **Model Definition and Evaluation**: Discuss the models you've implemented, the feature engineering steps you've taken, and how you evaluated their performance.

6. **Results**: Present the results in a clear and easy-to-understand format. Use tables, charts, or any other visual aids that you find appropriate.

7. **Discussion**: Reflect on the performance of your models compared to the baseline, and discuss any limitations and future work.

8. **Q&A**: Be prepared to answer questions from the audience or instructor.

## Structure

Your presentation should generally follow this structure:

1. **Title Slide**: Project name, your name, date, and any other relevant information.

2. **Introduction**: Briefly introduce your project.

3. **Literature Review**: 2-3 slides summarizing related work.

4. **Dataset Characteristics**: 1-2 slides.

5. **Baseline Model**: 1 slide.

6. **Model Definition and Evaluation**: 3-5 slides.

7. **Results**: 2-3 slides.

8. **Discussion**: 1-2 slides.

9. **Conclusion and Future Work**: 1 slide.

10. **Q&A**: Final slide indicating the Q&A session.

## Submission

1. Prepare your slides in a format that is easy to present and share (e.g., PowerPoint, Google Slides, PDF).
2. Make sure to include all code, graphs, and any other supplemental material that supports your presentation.
3. Submit any required files through the appropriate submission channel, as indicated by your instructor.
