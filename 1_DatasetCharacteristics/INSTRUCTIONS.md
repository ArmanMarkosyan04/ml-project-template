# Dataset Characteristics

## Overview

In this milestone, you are required to explore and analyze the dataset you are using for your project. Understanding your dataset is a critical component of any machine learning project.  
Utilize statistical graphics, plots, and information tables to summarize the dataset's main characteristics.

## Guidelines

1. **Dataset Overview**:
   Provide a high-level overview of the dataset. This should include the source of the dataset, the number of samples, the number of features, and example showing the structure of the dataset.

2. **Missing Values**:
   Identify any missing values in the dataset, and describe your approach to handle them if there are any. If there are no missing values simply indicate that tere are none.

3. **Feature Distributions**:
   Plot the distribution of various features and target variables. Comment on the skewness, outliers, or any other observations.

4. **Possible Biases**: Investigate the dataset for any biases that could affect the modelâ€™s performance and fairness (e.g., class imbalance, historical biases).

5. **Correlations**: Explore correlations between features and the target variable, as well as among features themselves.

## Submission

1. dataset characteristics content in this directory.
2. Make sure your Jupyter/Colab notebook is well-documented, with comments explaining your code and markdown cells interpreting your findings.

Use the [Jupyter/Colab notebook](exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb) in this folder as a basis to complete your analysis of the dataset characteristics.
