# Dataset Characteristics

## Overview

In this milestone, you are required to explore and analyze the dataset you are using for your project. Understanding your dataset is a critical component of any machine learning project.

## Guidelines

1. **Dataset Description**:
   [Provide a high-level overview of the dataset. This should include the source of the dataset, the number of samples, and the number of features.]

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   [Utilize statistical graphics, plots, and information tables to summarize the dataset's main characteristics. Use the provided Jupyter/Colab notebook (`exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`) to conduct your EDA.]

3. **Missing Values**:
   [Identify any missing values in the dataset, and describe your approach to handle them if there are any. If there are no missing values simply indicate that tere are none.]

4. **Feature Distributions**: Plot the distribution of various features and target variables. Comment on the skewness, outliers, or any other observations.

5. **Possible Biases**: Investigate the dataset for any biases that could affect the modelâ€™s performance and fairness (e.g., class imbalance, historical biases).

6. **Correlations**: Explore correlations between features and the target variable, as well as among features themselves.

## Structure

Your Dataset Characteristics should be organized as follows:

1. **Dataset Description**: Write this in a markdown file named `dataset_description.md`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Include plots, summary tables, and observations in the `exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`.

3. **Missing Values**: Mention this in your EDA notebook and describe the steps you took to handle them.

4. **Feature Distributions**: Include these plots in your EDA notebook.

5. **Possible Biases**: Discuss any biases in the dataset in your EDA notebook.

6. **Correlations**: Include a heatmap or table of feature correlations in your EDA notebook.

## Submission

1. Add your completed Dataset Characteristics content in this directory.
2. Make sure your Jupyter/Colab notebook is well-documented, with comments explaining your code and markdown cells interpreting your findings.
