# Baseline Model

## Overview

The purpose of this section is to establish a baseline model for your project. A baseline model is a simple model that serves as a point of comparison for any subsequent, more complex models you may build.

## Guidelines

1. **Choice of Model**: Explain why you've chosen a particular model as the baseline. This could be a simple statistical model or a basic machine learning model. Justify your choice.

2. **Feature Selection**: Indicate which features from the dataset you will be using for the baseline model, and justify your selection.

3. **Implementation**: Use the provided Jupyter/Colab notebook (`baseline_model.ipynb`) to implement your baseline model.

4. **Evaluation**: Clearly state what metrics you will use to evaluate the model's performance. These metrics will serve as a starting point for evaluating more complex models later on.

## Structure

Your Baseline Model should be organized as follows:

1. **Model Choice**: Describe your choice of baseline model in the `baseline_model.ipynb`.

2. **Feature Selection**: Indicate and justify your feature selection in the `baseline_model.ipynb`.

3. **Implementation**: Implement the model in the `baseline_model.ipynb`.

4. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using your chosen metrics and present the results in the `baseline_model.ipynb`.

## Submission

1. Add your completed Baseline Model implementation in this directory.
2. Make sure your Jupyter/Colab notebook is well-documented, with comments explaining your code and markdown cells interpreting your findings.
